## About the Plugin

While rewriting the plugin boilerplate that I have for building site-specific client plugins I set about to improve upon the At a Glance dashboard widget. I already had code written to add custom post types to the widget but to display the correct, corresponding icon I had to add CSS to the dashboard. The initial goal was to add the correct post type icon programmatically, which snowballed into this project.
