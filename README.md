## About the Plugin

While rewriting the plugin boilerplate that I have for building site-specific client plugins I set about to improve upon the At a Glance dashboard widget. I already had code written to add custom post types to the widget but to display the correct, corresponding icon I had to add CSS to the dashboard. The initial goal was to add the correct post type icon programmatically, which snowballed into this project.

Requires WordPress version 3.8 or higher, or any version of ClassicPress
