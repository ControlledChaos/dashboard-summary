Improves the At a Glance dashboard widget and offers replacement widgets with more detailed website and network information. Compatible with multisite installations and with ClassicPress.

## Website Summary Widget

The Website Summary dashboard widget by default replaces the native At a Glance dashboard widget, however both widgets can be displayed.

### User Roles for the Website Summary Widget

There are no settings to display the Website Summary widget by user role however the content of the widget is regulated by current user capabilities.

## At a Glance Widget

The native At a Glance widget is improved by this plugin.

A setting provides the ability to remove the At a Glance widget for all users, including the entry in the Screen Options section.

## Network Summary Widget

The Network Summary dashboard widget by default replaces the native Right Now dashboard widget, however both widgets can be displayed.

### User Roles for the Network Summary Widget

There are no settings to display the Network Summary widget by user role since the network dashboard, by default, is restricted to one user role. It is presumed that custom user roles with access to the network dashboard also have the cababilities to employ all of the content of this widget.

## Right Now Widget

This plugin does not modify the Right Now widget. A setting provides the ability to remove the Right Now widget for all users, including the entry in the Screen Options section.
